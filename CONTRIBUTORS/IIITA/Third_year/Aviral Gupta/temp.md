## Issue 431
<b>Ques - 2 Should I make some issues on GitHub workflows for some Maven and Gradle projects?</b><br>
Yes, it would be fun to learn something new.

<b>Ques - 4 If you have made only two commits for this task, then why there are only two, not three, and if there are three commits for this task then why there are three, not two? (Hint: Answer is related to stashing)</b>
There are only 2 commits because I stashed the changes two times only, therefore while applying those 2 stashes, I committed twice(one for each stashed changes).
```bash
stash@{0}: On 431b: Added Q2 and Q3
stash@{1}: On 431b: Answered 1st question
